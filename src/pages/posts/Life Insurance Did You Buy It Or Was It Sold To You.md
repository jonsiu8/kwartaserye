**A lot of people didn't buy their life insurance, it was sold to them.  What's the difference?**

In this article, I'm not gonna explain or convince you that you need life insurance.  In today's day and age it should already be the default - **Life Insurance is Important**.

We are talking about life insurance here not investments but somehow people gets confused with these two. But that's for another topic.

**If you have a life insurance policy now chances are you did not buy it**, it was sold to you by your insurance agent because almost nobody really shops around for life insurance.  This is usually how it works - you have a friend from college or an aunt or a brother-in-law who talked to you about it.  They keep on following you up until you're convinced (*or maybe got tired of the follow-ups*) to buy.

I don't have a problem with you buying life insurance this way as long as you bought the right type.  Thanks to the insurance agent you got a wake up call and insured yourself anyway.  

Here is the problem.  **This means that most people still don't think about protecting themselves first.** They go out of their way to protect the car and house but often forget themselves.

The bigger problem is that people often buy the wrong kind of life insurance, I'm not talking about what company, I really don't care where you buy it as long as it's **Term Life Insurance** - the best value for your money. (*The right type of life insurance is also for another topic.*)

But oftentimes **you just end up buying the life insurance product that the agent pushes** and not necessarily the best one for you.  I have nothing against agents, they are just doing their jobs, it's the insurance companies I think should change their marketing strategy.

**People today don't want to be told or pushed to buy or do something.**  They want to be informed properly and make their own decisions.  They need proper information and advise.  Find a financial educator that can give you proper insights and doesn't really care if buy from him/her or not.  And of course don't buy anything you don't understand.

If you're looking for life insurance yourself, shop around and look for the best deal for you.  **Don't just buy because you can't refuse your agent.**  Hey, if you can shop around looking for the best deals for food, shoes, bags, etc., why not life insurance, right?  It may be the key to start building your proper financial foundation.

###1. Save
...as much as you can, while you can. We will never know when is your last paycheck or business deal. Set a fix amount every time you get your earnings (20% or more).

###2. Invest
... make longterm goals and move towards it. When old age comes, you wouldn't want to worry and tire yourself of any business or job problems, unless you don't have choice but to work. Prepare for retirement. Check out some mutual funds or (PDFs) premium deposit funds. Real investments help you experience the benefits of compound interest to grow your wealth (Ask uncle Albert Einstein).

###3. Get Insured
... especially when you're bread winner or provider. An accident or health issue may cause loss of income. Worst thing is sudden death, where the family can be greatly devasted and affected by the loss of financial support and a loved one. Check out a good TERM or PURE insurance, that comes with affordable premium yet with huge coverage. (only buy TERM or PURE insurance).

###4. Get Healthcare
... choose an HMO with a Health Savings Account feature. This program helps you build funds for the future medical costs. Longterm care provides lifetime* financial support when you need the most.

###5. Get A Part-time Work
... manage your time in such a way that you have at least 2 to 3 hours extra. Use the extra hours to make some money doing part-time work. An extra Php5,000 a week can help. This may not be a formal job, but something freelance. This is a back-up plan to your job. Whatever you earn here, is active income so and invest it for longterm.

###6. Get Into Sales
... sell something, of course not just anything. üòÅ Something that gives value or simply the good stuff. Sell online, sell offline. This is another back-up plan to your job. Whatever you earn here, save and invest it for longterm.

###7. Get Into Entrepreneurship
... build a business with a system. A system turns your active income into passive income stream. If you are caught in a business that don't have a system - get out from that business. You will be wasting precious time.

Check out a business inside the financial industry. Financial industry is where the money is. Learn the advantage of a financial brokerage business over an insurance agency business. You will be amazed of the huge income potential as well as the vested benefits!

###8. Get Into A Training Profession
Train people with personal finance, social media/online distribution business- these are the most in-demand training businesses right now. As of writing, a new money industry emerges and is called FINTECH.

You can train people to be a Financial or Wealth Coach as well. As you share your knowledge and expertise - you duplicate yourself.

People today would want to learn for themselves and their families on how to develop and master money skills.

You can offer financial literacy classes in the workplace. No one is doing this venture.

It's a venture that focuses on training, education or coaching. üëå

You have less competition, less overhead and less start-up expense while you train people either online or onsite. You have less or no territory boundaries to do business.

Most importantly, you have a great cause.

But of course, you have to be a certified professional before you can do it. Check out a FINANCIAL planner/educator certification class near you. Attend workshops and be certified.

This special type of business creates value to your client-partners who are the employers and employees thru Financial Education.

It's a longterm partnership between you and your client-partner. As said, you have a great cause.

***Your life, your journey - but as the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child - we need a community to help us grow and achieve the things we hope for, moving towards our dreams and destiny of success and fulfillment.***
